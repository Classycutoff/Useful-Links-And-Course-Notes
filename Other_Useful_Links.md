### [Cross Site Scripting Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)
This cheat sheet provides guidance to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a misnomer. The name originated from early versions of the attack where stealing data cross-site was the primary focus. Since then, it has extended to include injection of basically any content, but we still refer to this as XSS. XSS is serious and can lead to account impersonation, observing user behaviour, loading external content, stealing sensitive data, and more.

### [Cross-Site Request Forgery Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of attack that occurs when a malicious web site, email, blog, instant message, or program causes a user's web browser to perform an unwanted action on a trusted site when the user is authenticated. A CSRF attack works because browser requests automatically include all cookies including session cookies. Therefore, if the user is authenticated to the site, the site cannot distinguish between legitimate authorized requests and forged authenticated requests. This attack is thwarted when proper Authorization is used, which implies that a challenge-response mechanism is required that verifies the identity and authority of the requester.

Yet another tool to dump a git repository from a website. goop tries to focus on as-complete-as-possible dumps and handling as many edge-cases as possible, compared to other tools, which seem to focus on bare minimum dumps. Original codebase heavily inspired by arthaud/git-dumper.

### [CTF Time](https://ctftime.org/ctfs)
There are a lot of Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions in our days, some of them have excelent tasks, but in most cases they're forgotten just after the CTF finished. We decided to make some kind of CTF archive and of course, it'll be too boring to have just an archive, so we made a place, where you can get some another CTF-related info - current overall Capture The Flag team rating, per-team statistics etc.
